1. variance.png contains a plot of mean variance for cilia pixels vs mean variance for cell + background pixels (labeled others) for the complete training dataset. There are two data points against each video: one for cilia and other for non-cilia (211*2 data points). 

2. The variance folder contains individual plots of pixel variance for each video. 

3. Thresholding folder contains side by side images of heat maps and masks for the videos.
